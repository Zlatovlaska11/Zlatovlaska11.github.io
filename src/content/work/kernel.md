### Project Overview

I developed a minimalist, experimental operating system kernel inspired by TempleOS, combining the memory safety of Rust with performant Assembly code where necessary. This project demonstrates my understanding of low-level system architecture and core operating system concepts.

### Key Features

#### Custom Filesystem Implementation
- Designed and built a hierarchical, tree-structured filesystem from scratch
- Implemented core filesystem operations including file creation, deletion, and navigation
- Created an intuitive interface for directory traversal and file management

#### Memory Management
- Implemented efficient memory allocation and deallocation routines
- Developed memory protection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access
- Created virtual memory mapping for process isolation

#### Process Scheduling
- Built a basic process scheduler to manage CPU time distribution
- Implemented context switching between different processes
- Established priority-based scheduling algorithms for optimal resource utilization

### Technical Challenges

Building this kernel required deep understanding of hardware interfaces, memory structures, and efficient resource management. The combination of Rust's safety features with Assembly's performance created a unique development experience that pushed the boundaries of my systems programming knowledge.

### Learning Outcomes

This project significantly strengthened my understanding of operating system internals, hardware-software interfaces, and low-level programming paradigms. It provided invaluable insights into how modern operating systems manage resources and maintain stability while serving multiple concurrent processes.
